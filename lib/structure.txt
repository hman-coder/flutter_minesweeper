// A file to write notes about the structure of the game

minesweeper_tile:
  flagged child
  mine child
  empty child
  animation config

minesweeper_tile_state:
  a tile can be one of three things: 1) Mine, 2) Number, 3)Empty. We will call those Static States (because they cannot be changed for the duration).
  a tile can be set as flagged regardless of its Static State.
  the Static State dictates what happens when the tile is explored (tapped).

  Active States are: 1) Explored 2) Unexplored (default) 3) Flagged
  These states can be changed (hence, they are active).

minesweeper_game:
  A grid of minesweeper_tile.
  It creates and dictates the state of minesweeper_tiles.
